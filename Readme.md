The course offers a practical introduction to a few programming languages and tools currently used in data science:

Python is a general-purpose, high-level and easy to learn programming language. It provides a large number of data science libraries (e.g. machine learning, neural networks, data manipulation, data visualization).
SQL is a standard language used to create, query, update and manage relational databases. For example, such databases are used to store large tables with results of experiments.
Git is a tool that allows to track changes in files during development of programs. It is the current standard for collaborative code development.
During the course the students will write Python programs of growing complexity (from basic coding examples to fitting a machine learning model). After this course you will be able to program simple reproducible data analyses (consisting of data reading, cleaning, simple modelling, and reporting steps). The state-of-the-art Python-specific data manipulation/visualization (pandas, Matplotlib) and data science libraries will be discussed.
Fundamentals of the relational databases and of the SQL language will be presented in a context of an example database (SQLite). The database will be accessed through direct SQL statements and through high-level object-oriented Python library (SQLAlchemy).
